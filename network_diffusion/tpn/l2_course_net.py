    Read `l2_course_net`.

    A network built from interactions between students during the three months
    long, abroad language course of the Arabic untertaken by 41 US students.
    This funciton loads a `TemporalNetwork` with three snapshots, each with two
    layers: `"ego"` (with edges picked as top 5 peers by each student) and
    `"course"` (with edges obtained by filtering out a complete graph according
    to a monthly questionarre).

    For details see a paper which analyses the network: "Peer Interaction
    Dynamics and Second Language Learning Trajectories During Study Abroad: A
    Longitudinal Investigation Using Dynamic Computational Social Network
    Analysis" by M.B. Paradowski, N. Whitby, M. Czuba, and P. BrÃ³dka in
    "Language Learning", 2024 (https://doi.org/10.1111/lang.12681). Please note
    that the networ used in paper was slightly different constructed: (1) it
    was a singlelayer network, (2) nodes 11 and 17 were discarded due to
    uncertainity of their data, (3) sources were not anonymised.

        language profficiency and psychological metrics with personal data).
    :param edge_features: wether to load features of the edges (intensity of
        contact and usage of the second language)
    :param directed: wether to load the network as a directed graph; if so
        nummerical attributes of edges between corresponding nodes are averaged
        while other attributes are discarded
